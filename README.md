# starpath

A position-aware parser combinator library for OCaml with readable errors.

Currently in a very early state with no documentation. Expect breaking changes.

Heavily based on [Angstrom](https://github.com/inhabitedtype/angstrom). If performance is important for your use-case, definitely check it out.
